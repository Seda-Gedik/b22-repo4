I just created Empty Remote repository from 
GitHub.com  account by clicing on the plus icon
on top right corner and new repository
and give a name and click create






And Cloned this repository by clicing on Set
up in Desktop and (Optionally select the 
location) click on clone 


It cloned our remote repo to local so we can 
start working locally
